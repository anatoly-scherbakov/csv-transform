# ysv

Stands for:

* Yeti CSV
* YAML driven CSV formatter

Clean up and transform CSV data based your rules encoded in YAML format. Lightning fast.

## Usage

Right now, the only method to use the app is:

```bash
cat samples/extra_value.csv | cargo run samples/sample.yaml
```

## Disclaimer

This is the first program I ever wrote in Rust programming language, and while I value clean and beautiful code a lot - the code of this particular app leaves much to desire. I will write down some known issues with it into Issues.
